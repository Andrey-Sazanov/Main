        <p>One of my favorite books is about algorithms. This book helped me understand the basics of the algorithms we use every day, such as Dijkstra's, which is the basis of the GPS system. I recommend this book to every programmer. Thanks to this book, I became interested in programming</p>

        <p>This is my second favorite book.My sister gave it to me because she knew about my interest in physics and space. The book tells about who Stephen Hawking is and how he became the way we know him. In general, the book is good for those who want to know a little more about their idol.</p>
